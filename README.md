<h1>What is BMI?</h1>

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a metric that computes the ratio of weight to the square of height, to determine where on a spectrum of healthy weight:height a person falls.

<h1>Technologies I used</h1>

<ol>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>React Hooks</li>
  <li>Raw CSS</li>
</ol>

<h1>How it works</h1>

The useState hook keeps track of the input when a user enters a figure in any of the fields. By using React Virtual DOM, there is no need to refresh the page or enter a submit button to display the computed value, the program does it itself.

<h1>Future improvements?</h1>

Yes! I am working, not actively though, on a feature that tells whether a returned BMI value is healthy or not. I also plan to add a feature that lets users choose their preferred metric, pounds or kilogrammes for weight, feet or metres for height.
